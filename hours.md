# Chad's Clocked Hours for CS 650R Final Project


| Date | Worked on? | Time (hrs) |
|------|------------|-------|
| 10/17 |Object image data collection, checkerboard data collection and camera callibration| 2 |
| 10/23 | Fixed camera calibration with images instead of a video, wrote script to find matching feature points between two images | 1.75 |
| 10/31 | Installed OpenSfM and began digging into it | 0.75 |
| 11/7 | Got OpenSfM working with Docker Containers & tested on Elephant data (only 2 images are being used so far) | 5 |
| 11/14 | Fixed OpenSfM bad results, to get really good results on PB container with simply more images. Began looking at converting a sparse point cloud to a dense one | 3 |
| 11/16 | Learning about Signed Distance Fields and densification of sparse point clouds | 1 |
| 11/18 | Densification of Sparse Point Clouds | 1.5 |
| 11/20 | Dense Point Clouds Continued | 4.5 |
| 11/21 | Stereo View Algorithm/Method to build a Dense Depth Map | 1.25 |
| 11/22 | Stereo View Algorithm/Method to build a Dense Depth Map, watching 4.1 lecture on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hr6xpOU-uw&t=3s (cont.) | 1.25 |
| 11/24 | Stereo View Algorithm/Method to build a Dense Depth Map, watched 4.1-4.2 lecture (cont.) | 1 |
| 11/25 | Stereo View Algorithm/Method to build a Dense Depth Map, watched 4.3-4.5 lecture (cont.). Outlined Densification plans. | 4 |
| 11/27 | Writing code to undistort images | 1 |
| 11/28 | Writing code to undistort and rectify images | 3 |
|| **Total hours worked thus far** | **31** |
|| **Hours Remaining out of 80  hours required** | **49** |
