# Research Notes and Papers

1. Densify Sparse Point Cloud
2. Remove Outliers
3. Estimate Normals of points
4. Get a surface from the Point Cloud using Poisson Surface Reconstruction

- Open3D = New Python Library as of 2019 that is the software behind displaying 3D geometries


## Densification of a Sparse Point Cloud

- TSDF (Truncated Signed Distance Field)
- CMVS/PMVS, Multi-View Environment (MVE), Shading-Aware Multi-View Stereo (SMVS)


## Or just jump straight to Differentiable Surface Splatting
